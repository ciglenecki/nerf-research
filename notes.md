# Research notes

## Papers

### mip-nerf

* extends NeRF to represent the scene at a continuously-value scale
* rendering anti-aliased conical frustums instead of rays
* preserves fine details
* 7% faster than NeRF
* 1/2 size of NeRF
* reduces avg. error by 17%
* reduces avg. error by 60% on a challenging multiscale variant dataset
* Our

frustum - portion of a solid (normally a pyramid or a cone) that lies between one or two parallel planes cutting it

mipmap


Todo:
* box downsampling
*
